                <h3>Blog Title 1</h3>
                <p> Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry.<br>
                    Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s,
                    when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book.<br>
                    It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. <br>
                    It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, 
                    and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.<br>
                    It is a long established fact that a reader will be distracted by the readable content of a page when looking at its layout. <br>
                    The point of using Lorem Ipsum is that it has a more-or-less normal distribution of letters, as opposed to using 'Content here, content here', making it look like readable English. <br>
                    Many desktop publishing packages and web page editors now use Lorem Ipsum as their default model text, and a search for 'lorem ipsum' will uncover many web sites still in their infancy. <br>
                    Various versions have evolved over the years, sometimes by accident, sometimes on purpose (injected humour and the like).
